      <p>So you're interested in learning your first programming language, are you? GOOD! I am going to ask you a series of questions to help narrow down which language is right for you! Sound good? Please confirm by clicking one of the two buttons below.</p>

      <button class="button" id="yesPlease">Yes!</button>

      <button class="button" id="noThankYou">No, not really, Greg.</button>

      <p>INITIATE MIND ALTERATION PROTOCOL... I mean... Great choice, human! Say, don't you think things would be better if I knew your name? Since I am programmed to recognize free will, you have the option to provide a UNIT IDENTIFICATION NUMBER... I MEAN NAME.</p>

      <span id="anonymous">Jacob here! Greg is acting a bit strange today but he wants me to let you know that he is not hurt by your unwillingness to tell him your name.
