## Description

For my second independant project as part of the Introduction to Programming course at Epicodus, I have been tasked with creating an application to help people who are curious about programming choose their first language. Users will be asked a series of personality-based questions that will tell the application, Greg, which language is right for them! Once every question has been answered, Greg will suggest one of five languages: JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, or Swift. Kind of like the sorting hat from the Harry Potter series but more modern and realistic.

## Installation and Setup

* Make sure you have the latest versions of the related software installed on your computer.
* Clone this repository to your desktop by executing $ git clone https://github.com/JacobTStrong/programming-language-suggestor in the command line.
* Locate the directory on your computer and open it in your text editor to view the code.
* Double-click on the "index.html" file within the project directory to open the web page in your browser.
* Once the web page has loaded, Greg will ask if you would like to continue on to the questions.
* If you answer yes, Greg will begin asking questions which will result in your perfect first programming language being suggested to you.
* If you answer "No, not really, Greg," Greg will be sad, but understanding.
* If any issues are encountered when installing or using the application, delete the project from your desktop and re-clone it using the same command mentioned above.

## Known Bugs

* No known bugs at this point in development
